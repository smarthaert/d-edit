                Turbo Professional BONUS Subdirectory
                -------------------------------------

The files in this subdirectory are non-commercial units and utilities
developed for Turbo Pascal by a variety of authors, including us at
TurboPower Software. Many of the utilities build upon Turbo
Professional units; others stand by themselves. Almost all have
complete source code, so you can use them, modify them, or just study
them for ideas.

TurboPower Software provides this BONUS subdirectory as a free service
to our customers.

TurboPower Software offers no warranty, express or implied, for the
programs in the BONUS subdirectory. You may use a BONUS unit bearing
the TurboPower copyright within any application that you write,
without restriction. Other programs in the BONUS subdirectory have
either been released to the public domain by their authors, or are
distributed here by their express permission. You may give copies of
the files in the BONUS subdirectory to anyone.

If you have a unit or utility that you think would be an appropriate
addition to the BONUS subdirectory, please let us know.

Each unit has been compressed into an LZH file with its supporting
files in order to save disk space. To extract the individual files,
use the supplied LHARC.EXE program. From the DOS prompt, enter

  LHARC X ArchiveName

For example, LHARC X CHAIN would extract all of the files from the
CHAIN archive.

The following descriptions indicate whether the associated files are
compatible with DOS protected mode operation using Borland Pascal 7.0 by
placing (pmode) after the description.

Here's a brief description of the BONUS files.

ASYNC4
  A simple but effective set of asynchronous communications routines.
  Emulates the popular ASYNC.INC from Turbo 3. (pmode)

CHAIN
  A unit that adds a Chain command to Turbo 4, 5, 6, or 7.

COLORDEF
  A unit that defines constants corresponding to all the foreground on
  background color combinations, e.g., YellowOnBlue. (pmode)

EXECWIN
  A unit that execs a child process, keeping its output in a window.
  (pmode)

EXTEND
  A unit for increasing the number of file handles available to a
  program.

LHARCMAN
  Documentation for the LHARC archiving utility.

LPT
  A unit that replaces the Turbo PRINTER unit with one using BIOS
  calls for improved speed and binary output capability. (pmode)

  heap usage of a program.

OPTIMER
  A unit to take timings with microsecond resolution. (pmode)

TPCLONE
  A unit that assists in the writing of installation programs. (pmode)

TPENV
  A number of routines to manipulate the DOS environment, including
  one to execute a DOS shell with a custom prompt. (Use Object
  Professional's OPDOS unit for pmode applications)

  modify the key assignments for the TPEDIT, TPENTRY, TPHELP, TPMENU,
  and TPPICK units. (pmode)
